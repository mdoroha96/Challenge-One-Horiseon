# <Horiseon Challenge One>

## Description

Web page that has functioning links and image sources. Also consolidated HTML and CSS. 

- Motivation for this project was to create a web that had consolidated VS Code. Make sure that the layout of the page matched 90% of starter code. Also to create a codebase that follows accessibility standars so that the  site is optimized for search engines, as listed in user story.  
-This project was built for experience and practice of HTML elements, structure of HTML elements, and elements to follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. 
- Problems that were solved within this project are of the following: Image links were applied correctly so they were visible within the live webpage, also added in a missing image link. Also applying a link for "search-engine-optimizing". Correcting the styles sheets link so that the styling content was visible. Also consolidating elements and organizing these elements. 
- Information that learned during this project was how to properly link styling sheet within HTML. How to properly consolidate elements within headers. Also how to input background and font color. How to input image and link content within the code.
